<p>Some things about me. (Kind of how my life has gone so far.) I was born September 7th, 1989 in 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow" target="_blank">Moscow, Russia</a>. In August of 1996, me and 
my family immigrated overseas and started living the American Dream in Brooklyn, NY. In 2001, we moved 
to Rockland County - Suffern, NY to be exact. Around this time, I developed a deep love for guitar
and songwriting. After finishing High School there, I started going to RCC (Rockland Community College). 
At the same time I was the lead vocalist in a post-hardc0re band called Vital Limit. After we broke up, 
and during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_movement" target="_blank">Occupy movement of 2011</a>, I 
packed my bag and traveled the country by myself mostly by bus (at other times by train, truck, and 
once by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-trailer_truck" target="_blank">16-wheel semi</a>). After making it 
all the way to Los Angeles and having had achieved what I set out to do, I bought a plane ticket home. 
I moved to New Paltz Village in 2012 to continue college at New Paltz University, and in May of 2016 I 
had finished my Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science. After that, and due to my love of California, I 
drove across the country on a beat up 1996 Dodge Escort on $700. I started fixing phones at the Carlsbad 
Mall, got an apartment and started a new life. After covid left me homeless on Venice beach (and trust me, 
I loved every minute of living in my car on the beach), I moved to Milwaukee, WI for a better quality of life 
(you know: apartment, hot water, shower, etc.) which is where I reside now. I have many new projects in 
the works for you all so stay tuned! Love, DM</p>
